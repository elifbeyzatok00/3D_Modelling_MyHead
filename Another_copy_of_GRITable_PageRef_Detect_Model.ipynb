            "(3, '3\\nCorporate Responsibility Report 2016\\nElisabeth Grieg\\nChair, Board of Directors\\nThe world around us is changing at a pace \\nwe’re hardly able to capture, and sometimes in \\ndirections difficult to foresee. Yet, we must do \\nour best to understand, because the future of \\nthe maritime industry is indisputably inter-\\ntwined with the deeper changes in geopolitics, \\nworld economy and human development.   \\nA constant state of change has always been a \\nfeature of our industry, and we know very well \\nthat there are moments when more radical \\nshifts will occur. I believe we’re at the thresh-\\nold of such a moment right now. Driving this \\nrevolution are threats from climate change and \\nprofound social instability, combined with op-\\nportunities produced by the staggering rise of \\nurban middle-class and \\nbreathtaking techno-\\nlogical developments in \\nan ever more globalized \\nand knowledge-driven \\neconomy.  Together, \\nthey will fundamentally \\nimpact and change the way we live our lives \\nand do our business.\\nIt is troubling to see how some respond to \\nthese changes by retracting from the global \\ncommunity, ignoring our commonalities and \\nundermining shared international commit-\\nments. It is worrying when countries we used \\nto trust as standard-bearers for an open, \\nfree and inclusive world now are feasting \\non self-centered concepts of a world divid-\\ned between us and them, encouraged by a \\npublic outcry for higher barriers and stronger \\nborders.  \\nThat is not our way.  True, the shipping mar-\\nkets have been in turmoil since the economic \\ncrisis hit us in 2008. And yes, many of us have \\nbeen through some serious struggles just to \\nsurvive these last years. And I know, we still \\nhave difficulties ahead of us. But we have \\nalso learned that risks can emerge hand in \\nhand with new and exciting opportunities.

The box-shaped holds, efficient cranes, dehumidification systems and state-of-\\nthe-art cargo equipment, enable loading and discharge of the cargo with minimum \\nhandling, ensuring safe stowage and minimum delays. Dehumidification systems \\nensure that the air quality in the holds is right for the various types of goods carried. \\nFurther, the vessels’ unobstructed deck, included tween decks, provides for excellent \\nstowage, and a safe and damage free ocean transit for various project cargoes. \\nOur conventional bulk department presently operates a modern fleet of about 10 \\nowned and chartered geared and grab-fitted ships ranging from 25,000 to 81,000 \\nDWT, combining contracts and tramping in worldwide trades.

For Grieg Star it is important to reduce the \\nfuel usage of our ships. In 2016 we burned 170,489 tons of fuel, emitting 532,987 \\ntons of CO2.
